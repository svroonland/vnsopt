Variable Neighbourhood Search with Variable Neighbourhood Descent optimization implementations in python

# About
Implementation of Variable Neighbourhood Search and Variable Neighbourhood Descent meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. See [Hansen 2017](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306084902_Variable_neighborhood_search_basics_and_variants)

In this library, a neighbourhood is a function that generates solutions nearby a given solution. It is implemented in this library as functions returning generators.
